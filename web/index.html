<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Counting
<a href="https://metrics.torproject.org/networksize.html">almost 7,000 relays</a>,
<a href="https://www.torproject.org">the Tor network</a>
is one of the largest volunteer-run anonymity networks operating today.  Most of
the volunteers who operate these relays choose to remain anonymous, and little
is known about how they set up or operate their relays.  As a result, it is not
clear if all relays correctly generated the cryptographic key material that is
needed to participate in the Tor network.  Key generation issues can have
devastating consequences, and led to severe vulnerabilities
<a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571">in</a>
<a href="https://factorable.net">the</a>
<a href="https://smartfacts.cr.yp.to/smartfacts-20130916.pdf">past</a>,
emphasizing the importance of knowing if the Tor network is affected by the same
weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
In this research project, we took a closer look at the cryptographic keys of Tor
relays.  Drawing on a
<a href="https://collector.torproject.org/archive/relay-descriptors/server-descriptors/">dataset
containing more than ten years worth of archived Tor relay public keys</a>,
(<i>i</i>) we checked if any relays share prime factors or moduli, (<i>ii</i>)
we identified relays that used non-standard RSA exponents, and (<i>iii</i>) we
characterized malicious relays that we discovered in the first two steps.  Our
experiments revealed that ten relays shared moduli, and 3,557 relays&mdash;most
part of a research project&mdash;shared prime factors, allowing adversaries to
reconstruct private keys.  We further discovered 122 relays that used
non-standard RSA exponents, presumably in an attempt to attack onion services.
By simulating how onion services are positioned in Tor&rsquo;s distributed hash
table, we could identify four onion services that were likely targeted by these
malicious relays.
</p>

<p>
What does our work mean for Tor users?  There is no need for concern.  While we
discovered that some relays were vulnerable in the past, these relays are no
longer online, and there is no reason to believe that the vulnerabilities were
exploited.  In addition to demonstrating these issues, we suggest
countermeasures that The Tor Project can adopt to find vulnerable relays early,
and remove them from the network.  As a result, our work further strengthens the
security of the Tor network.

<h2><a name="code">Code</a></h2>
<p>
Our
<a href="https://github.com/citp/anomalous-tor-keys">GitHub repository</a>
contains the LaTeX code of our paper, and our Python and Go code snippets:
</p>

<div class="centered">
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/citp/anomalous-tor-keys.git

<p>
The repository also contains our tool <tt>itos</tt> that we used to identify
onion services that were likely targeted by malicious onion service directories.
Run <tt>itos -h</tt> for a list of supported options.  You can run the tool as
follows:
</p>

<pre>
$ cd anomalous-tor-keys/code/itos/
$ go build itos.go
$ ./itos -hss onion-services.csv -hsdirs hsdirs.csv
</pre>
