\begin{abstract}
In its more than ten years of existence, the Tor network has seen hundreds of
thousands of relays come and go.  Each relay maintains several RSA keys,
amounting to millions of keys, all archived by The Tor Project.
%
In this paper, we analyze 3.7 million RSA public keys of Tor relays.  We \first
check if any relays share prime factors or moduli, \second identify relays that
use non-standard exponents, \third characterize malicious relays that we
discovered in the first two steps, and \fourth develop a tool that can determine
what onion services fell prey to said malicious relays.
%
Our experiments revealed that ten relays shared moduli, and 3,557
relays---almost all part of a research project---shared prime factors, allowing
adversaries to reconstruct private keys.  We further discovered 122 relays that
used non-standard RSA exponents, presumably in an attempt to attack onion
services.  By simulating how onion services are positioned in Tor's distributed
hash table, we identified four onion services that were targeted by these
malicious relays.
%
Our work provides both The Tor Project and onion service operators with tools to
identify misconfigured and malicious Tor relays, to stop attacks before they
pose a threat to Tor users.
