\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
We present our results in four parts, starting with shared prime factors
(Section~\ref{sec:shared-primes}), followed by shared moduli
(Section~\ref{sec:shared-moduli}), unusual exponents 
(Section~\ref{sec:unusual-exponents}), and finally targeted onion services
(Section~\ref{sec:targeted-onion-services}).

\subsection{Shared prime factors}
\label{sec:shared-primes}
Among all 588,945 identity keys, fastgcd found that 3,557 (0.6\%)
moduli share prime factors.  We believe that 3,555 of these keys were all
controlled by a single research group and upon contacting the authors of the
Security \& Privacy 2013 paper entitled ``Trawling for Tor hidden
services''~\cite{Biryukov2013a}, we received confirmation that these relays
indeed were run by their research group.  The authors informed us that the weak
keys were caused by a shortcoming of their key generation utility. The issue
stemmed from the fact that their tool first generated thousands of prime numbers
and then computed multiple moduli using combinations of those prime numbers in a
greedy fashion, without ensuring that the same primes were not reused.

Because of the following shared properties, we are confident that all relays
were operated by the same group:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item All relays were online either in between November 11, 2012 and
		November 16, 2012 or in between January 14, 2013 and February 6, 2013,
		suggesting two separate experiments. We verified this by checking how
		long the relays stayed in the Tor network consensus. The Tor consensus
		is updated hourly and documents which relays are available at a
		particular time. This data is archived by The Tor Project, and is made
		publically available on the CollecTor platform~\cite{collector}.

	\item All relays exhibited a predictable port assignment scheme.  In
		particular, we observed ports \{7003, 7007, \dots, 7043, 7047\} and
		\{8003, 8007, \dots, 8043, 8047\}.

	\item Except for two machines that were located in Russia and Luxembourg,
		all machines were hosted in Amazon's EC2 address space.  All machines
		except the one located in Luxembourg used Tor version 0.2.2.37.

	\item All physical machines had multiple fingerprints.  1,321 of these 3,557
		relays were previously characterized by Winter
		\ea~\cite[\S~5.1]{Winter2016a}.
\end{enumerate}

The remaining two keys belonged to a relay named ``DesasterBlaster,'' whose
origins we could not determine. Its router descriptor indicates that the relay
has been hosted on a MIPS machine which might suggest an embedded device with a
weak random number generator:

\begin{verbatim}
router DesasterBlaster 62.226.55.122 9001 0 0
platform Tor 0.2.2.13-alpha on Linux mips
\end{verbatim}

To further investigate, we checked whether the relay ``DesasterBlaster'' shares
prime factors with any other relays. It appears that the relay has rotated
multiple identity keys, and it only shares prime factors with its own keys.


\subsection{Shared moduli}
\label{sec:shared-moduli}
In addition to finding shared prime factors, we discovered relays that share a
\emph{modulus}, giving them the ability to calculate each other's private keys.
With $p$, $q$, and each other's $e$'s in hand, the two parties can then compute
each other's decryption exponent $d$, at which point both parties now know the
private decryption keys.

Table~\ref{tab:moduli} shows these ten relays with shared moduli, clustered into
four groups. The table shows the relays' truncated, four-byte fingerprint, IP
addresses, and RSA exponents.  Note that the Tor client hard-codes the RSA
exponent to 65,537~\cite[\S~0.3]{torspec}, a recommended value that is resistant
to attacks against low public exponents~\cite[\S~4]{Boneh1999a}.  Any other
value indicates non-standard key generation.  All IP addresses were hosted by
OVH, a popular French hosting provider, and some of the IP addresses hosted two
relays, as our color coding indicates.  Finally, each group shared a four- or
five-digit prefix in their fingerprints.  We believe that a single attacker
controlled all these relays with the intention to manipulate the distributed
hash table that powers onion services~\cite{Biryukov2013a}---the shared
fingerprint prefix is an indication.  Since the modulus is identical, we suspect
that the attackers iterated over the relays' RSA exponents to come up with the
shared prefix.  The Tor Project informed us that it discovered and blocked these
relays in August 2014, when they first came online.

\subsection{Unusual exponents}
\label{sec:unusual-exponents}
The Tor source code hard-codes the public RSA exponent to 65,537, which is best
practice~\cite[\S~4]{Boneh1999a}.  Interested in non-standard key generation, we
checked if our dataset featured relays with different exponents.  Non-standard
exponents may indicate that a relay was after a specific fingerprint in order to
position itself in Tor's hash ring.\footnote{A different approach to detecting
relays that position themselves in the hash ring is to determine how often they
change their fingerprints.~\cite[\S~4.3.3]{Winter2016a}} To obtain a fingerprint
with a given prefix, an adversary has to modify the underlying key material $p$,
$q$, and $e$ until they result in the desired prefix.  Repeated modification of
$e$ is significantly more efficient than modifying $p$ or $q$ because it is
costly to verify if a large number is prime.  Leveraging this method, the tool
Scallion~\cite{scallion} generates vanity onion service domains by iterating
over the service's public exponent.

Among all of our 3.7 million keys, 122 possessed an exponent other than
65,537.\footnote{We list all relays in detail in
Appendix~\ref{sec:full-unusual-exponents}.} One relay had both non-standard
identity \emph{and} onion key exponents while all remaining relays only had
non-standard identity key exponents.  Ten of these relays further had a shared
modulus, which we discuss in Section~\ref{sec:shared-moduli}.  Assuming that
these relays positioned themselves in the hash ring to attack an onion service,
we wanted to find out what onion services they targeted.  One can identify the
victims by first compiling a comprehensive list of onion services and then
determining each service's position in the hash ring at the time the malicious
HSDirs were online.

\subsection{Identifying targeted onion services}
\label{sec:targeted-onion-services}

We obtained a list of onion services by augmenting the list of the Ahmia
search engine~\cite{ahmia} with services that we discovered via Google searches
and by contacting researchers who have done similar work~\cite{Matic2015a}.  We
ended up with a list of 17,198 onion services that were online at some point in
time.  Next, we developed a tool that takes as input our list of onion services
and the malicious HSDirs we discovered.\footnote{Both the tool and our list of
onion services are available online at \url{https://nymity.ch/weak-tor-keys/}.}
The tool then determines all descriptors these onion services ever generated and
checks if any HSDir shared five or more hex digits in its fingerprint prefix
with the onion service's descriptor.

It is difficult to identify all targeted onion services with certainty.  First,
our list of onion services does not tell us when a service was online.  Second,
an HSDir could be responsible for an onion service simply by chance, instead of
on purpose, resulting in a false positive.  Third, our list of onion services is
not exhaustive, so we are bound to miss some potential victims.  Our tool
identified the following four onion services for which we have strong evidence
that they were purposely targeted:

\begin{description}
	\item[\texttt{22u75kqyl666joi2.onion}] The service appears to be offline
		today, so we were unable to see for ourselves what it hosted.  According
		to cached index pages we found online, the onion service used to host a
		technology-focused forum in Chinese.  A subset of relays from
		Table~\ref{tab:group2} targeted the onion service on both August 14 and
		15, 2015 by providing nine out of the total of twelve responsible
		HSDirs.

	\item[\texttt{n3q7l52nfpm77vnf.onion}] As of February 2017, the service is
		still online, hosting the ``Marxists Internet Archive,'' an online
		archive of literature.\footnote{The onion service seems to be identical
		to the website \url{https://www.marxists.org}.} Figure~\ref{fig:archive}
		shows a screenshot of the service's index page.  A subset of relays from
		Table~\ref{tab:group1} targeted the onion service from November 27 to
		December 4, 2016.  The malicious HSDirs acted inconsistently,
		occasionally targeting only one replica.

	\item[\texttt{silkroadvb5piz3r.onion}] The onion service used to host the
		Silk Road marketplace, whose predominant use was a market for narcotics.
		The service was targeted by a subset of relays from
		Table~\ref{tab:group4}, from May 21 to June 3, 2013.  The HSDirs were
		part of a measurement experiment that resulted in a blog
		post~\cite{OCearbhaill2013a}.

	\item[\texttt{thehub7gqe43miyc.onion}] The onion service used to host a
		discussion forum, ``The Hub,'' focused on darknet markets.  A subset of
		relays from Table~\ref{tab:group2} targeted both of The Hub's replicas
		from August 22, 2015.
\end{description}

It is not clear what the HSDirs did once they controlled the replicas
of the onion services they targeted.  The HSDirs could have counted the number
of client requests, refused to serve the onion service's descriptor to take it
offline, or correlate client requests with guard relay traffic, to deanonymize
onion service visitors~\cite{Dingledine2014a}.
